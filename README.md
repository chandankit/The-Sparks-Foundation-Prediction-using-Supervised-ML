# The-Sparks-Foundation-Prediction-using-Supervised-ML
The Sparks Foundation provided the dataset for this repository, with the problem statement being to estimate a student's percentage based on the number of study hours using supervised machine learning. 

The data consist of one predictor variable and one response variable. Thus I have used the Simple Linear Regression model to predict the Percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.

Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?
